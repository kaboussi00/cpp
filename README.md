# cpp
C++ is a general purpose programming language which was first developed in the 1980s. The language was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup under with the name “C with classes”.

C++ is a version of C that includes Object-Oriented elements, including classes and functions.
# C++ Project
This C++ project is divided into several modules, each covering specific aspects of the C++ language and programming concepts. Below is an overview of each module:

## cpp_module_00:
### Namespaces, Classes, Member Functions, stdio Streams, Initialization Lists, Static, Const, and Basic Concepts
- Namespaces: Introduction to namespaces for organizing code.
- Classes: Definition and implementation of classes to encapsulate data and behavior.
- Member Functions: Implementation of member functions within classes.
- stdio Streams: Basic input and output using standard streams.
- Initialization Lists: Utilizing initialization lists for efficient member initialization.
- Static: Understanding static members within classes.
- Const: Proper usage of const qualifiers for member functions and variables.
- Other Basic Concepts: Introduction to fundamental C++ concepts.
## cpp_module_01:
### Memory Allocation, Pointers to Members, References, Switch Statement
- Memory Allocation: Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
- Pointers to Members: Understanding pointers to class members.
- References: Usage of references in C++.
- Switch Statement: Implementation and usage of the switch statement.
## cpp_module_02: 
### Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, Orthodox Canonical Class Form
- Ad-hoc Polymorphism: Introduction to ad-hoc polymorphism in C++.
- Operator Overloading: Overloading operators for user-defined types.
- Orthodox Canonical Class Form: Defining the canonical form for classes in C++.
## cpp_module_03: 
### Inheritance
- Inheritance: Understanding and implementing inheritance in C++.
## cpp_module_04: 
### Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
- Subtype Polymorphism: Implementation and usage of subtype polymorphism.
