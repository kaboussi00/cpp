- # c++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was first developed in the 1980s. The language was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup under the name "C with classes".

C++ is a version of C that includes Object-Oriented elements, including classes and functions.

# C++ Project

This C++ project is divided into several modules, each covering specific aspects of the C++ language and programming concepts. Below is an overview of each module:

## cpp_module_00:
